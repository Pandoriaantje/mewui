What is MEWUI?
=============

MEWUI stands for MAME Extended Windows User Interface.

MEWUI is a frontend for MAME, which unlike the other uses its internal graphics interface.

The benefit is that it is cross-platform, can be compiled in any OS supported by MAME itself, always keeping the same look.


How to compile?
=============

If you're on a *nix system, it could be as easy as typing

```
make TARGET=mewui
```

For Windows users, MAME devs provide a ready-made [build environment](http://mamedev.org/tools/) based on MinGW-w64. [Visual Studio builds](http://wiki.mamedev.org/index.php?title=Building_MAME_using_Microsoft_Visual_Studio_compilers) are also possible.
